### Activity 0101:  Adapted from The Pragmatic Programmer
I was given an exercise that test an user input year is a leap year or not. So I have:
       <boolean x = (year % 4) == 0;>
       <boolean y = (year % 100) != 0;>
       <boolean z = ((year % 100 == 0) && (year % 400 == 0));>
But I don't know how to combine them into one true condition to include in if else statement. I tried each way like splitting them into several if else statements, however they need combination, not split. The only way and arguably the best is to combine them into a single line of code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
